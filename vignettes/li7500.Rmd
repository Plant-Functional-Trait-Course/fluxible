In this vignette, we will see how to read the data from the setup described in @halbritterPlantTraitVegetation2024 and compare the output calculated with fluxible with the published data.

The code used to import the data might be turned into a package later.

## Importing and reading the files

First, we import the data from OSF using the [dataDownloader](https://github.com/Between-the-Fjords/dataDownloader) R package.

```{r osf-import, include = FALSE}

```
